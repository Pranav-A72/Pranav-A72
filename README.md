Hi my name is Pranav, I am a high school student and hope to pursue a future in Computer Science.
I code mostly in C# and am pretty proficient with most object- oriented work. I also have a basic understanding of web development.
I use the Unity Engine. 

I AM NOT AN ARTIST

I play Valorant in my free time.
